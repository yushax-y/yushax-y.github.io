#### Bluetooth Speaker 
My peers and I fixed a broken Bluetooth speaker by removing the battery and witing up resistors to limit the voltage.
### Exploring Linux
Learning Linux was a whole nother journey in itself. My first exposure to Linux was through Cinnamon and I liked it. The freedom you have in Linux distros is just unmatched. Then my teacher asked us to make our own PCs from scrap parts and try to download any distro of Linux. My friends and I took this as a challenge and tried downloading Arch through the base install. It took me two tries but I got it at the end. I then installed my first GUI (KDE Plasma) and started exploring the possibilities of Linux customization or "ricing". I installed Nano but then transitioned to neovim. I started exploring Hyperland and had to learn how config files work and what dotfiles are through Reddit. My main workflow is on an Arch/KDE Plasma/Hyperland and a Windows computer. Still have a long way to understanding and mastering Linux. You can see my journey on my [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/yushax_y/).
